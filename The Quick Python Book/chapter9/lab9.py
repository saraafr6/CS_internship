'''Looking back at the labs in chapters 6 and 7, refactor that code into functions for cleaning and processing the data. The goal
should be that most of the logic is moved into functions. Use your own judgment as to the types of functions and parameters, but keep in mind that functions should do just one thing, and they shouldnâ€™t have any side effects that
carry over outside the function.'''
