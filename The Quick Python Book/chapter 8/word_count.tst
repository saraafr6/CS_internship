This code can give you an idea of a Python program. There isn’t much code, and most
of the work gets done in three lines of code in the for loop. In fact, this program
could be made even shorter and more idiomatic. Most Pythonistas see this conciseness
as one of Python’s great strengths.
 REFACTOR WORD_COUNT Rewrite the word-count program from section
to make it shorter. You may want to look at the string and list operations
already discussed, as well as think about different ways to organize the code.
You may also want to make the program smarter so that only alphabetic
strings (not symbols or punctuation) count as words.
