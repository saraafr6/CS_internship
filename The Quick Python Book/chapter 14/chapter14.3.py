QUICK CHECK: CONTEXT MANAGERS Assume that you’re using a context manager in a script that reads and/or writes several files. Which of the following
approaches do you think would be best?
 Put the entire script in a block managed by a with statement.
 Use one with statement for all file reads and another for all file writes.
 Use a with statement each time you read a file or write a file (for each line,
for example).
 Use a with statement for each file that you read or write.
